# d3meetup

A quick walkthrough garmin/strava data for the local d3 meetup.

A quick view of the results is available through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cnuernber/d3meetup/blob/3b9e33d6e1b622983bef9a0a9983c868940b378f/walkthrough.ipynb).

# Usage

First install java 8 and then clojure.  Java 8 is system specific but I recommend installing clojure from [here](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).

If you want to actually run the clojure repl then install [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) and run 'lein repl'.

The repl experience via pure lein repl is rough so you have can install [things](https://lambdaisland.com/guides/clojure-repls/clojure-repls) to help you with this or you can jump into intelliJ, install cursive, and go from there.

Assuming you have clojure installed and the [jupyter notebook system](https://jupyter.org/install) installed, here is a quick start:

```bash
git submodule update --recursive --init


scripts/get-data.sh

pushd clojupyter
make && make install
popd

jupyter-notebook
```

If you like, you can run a condensed form of the project from the repl.  Just open [doit.clj](src/d3meetup/doit.clj).

The chart interactivity isn't as nice in the repl form.  But the development experience is a hell of a lot better.
