    "Clojure is an implementation of a dialect of languages named LISP.  This version of LISP runs on the jvm.  Being a LISP means that it is homoiconic, or that programs in clojure are expressed in the datastructures of clojure.  Many great minds have worked to design this modern LISP and it has an extremely well though out foundation.   \n",
